# WHAM

It is very common for physical therapists to assign activities like Wii games for PT, however once the patients leave the hospital or clinic, there is no way for the therapists to track their progress. The Wearable Home Activity Monitor (WHAM) is a Northeastern ReGame VR Lab project that is attempting to solve this problem.  

We are developing a cheap sensor system that can be used to track the data of patients like range of motion, engagement, heart rate, and many others. Featured on this GitHub Repository are all the software parts to this project.
